Not much actually wrong with this model - just refined using old methods. Most of the outliers correct on energy minimisation, leaving just two histidines and an arginine as the only structural rotamers in need of correction. Deleted all waters with B-factors higher than 50, rebuilt and refined in phenix.refine with automatic water updating, then made a second pass in ISOLDE manually placing a few more waters. Refinement starting from the original B-factors was unstable, so reset all atoms to the Wilson B before refining. Final refinement in Phenix used the starting model as a reference, and did not further update waters.
