**Protein name**: nsp10

**Organism**: SARS-CoV-2

**Method**: NMR

## Description

nsp16-nsp10 heterodimer from SARS-CoV-2 in complex with SAM (without additional SAM during crystallization). Methyltransferase nsp-16 interacts with nsp-10 to mediate mRNA cap methylation of viral mRNAs. S-Adenosylmethionin could influence the assembly and function of the methyltransfrase-complex.
