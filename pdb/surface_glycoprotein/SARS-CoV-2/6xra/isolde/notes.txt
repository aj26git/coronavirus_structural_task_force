Protein component appeared mostly OK (a few peptide bond flips and rotamer adjustments)
Glycans were problematic:
  - some flipped around Asn-NAG bond
  - some missing link to protein (prior to refinement - Asn and NAG had been pushed apart)
  - BMA (beta-mannose) residues incorrectly modelled as MAN (alpha-mannose)
  - some terminal MAN residues unlinked

Stem helices are poorly resolved.
