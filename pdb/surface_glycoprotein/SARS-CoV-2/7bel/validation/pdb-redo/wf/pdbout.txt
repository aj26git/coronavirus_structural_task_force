********** REPORT OF PROTEIN ANALYSIS  by the WHAT IF program **********
************************************************************************

Date : 2021-03-05
This report was created by WHAT IF version WHATCHECK15.0

This document is a WHAT_CHECK 14.0 report for a PDB-file. Each reported
fact has an assigned severity, one of:

error  : Items marked as errors are considered severe problems requiring
         immediate attention.
warning: Either less severe problems or uncommon structural features. These
         still need special attention.
note   : Statistical values, plots, or other verbose results of tests and
         analyses that have been performed.

If alternate conformations are present, only the first is evaluated. Hydrogen
atoms are only included if explicitly requested, and even then they are not
used in all checks. The software functions less well for non-canonical amino
acids and exotic ligands than for the 20 canonical residues and canonical
nucleic acids.

Some remarks regarding the output:

Residues/atoms in tables are normally given in a few parts:

A number. This is the internal sequence number of the residue used by WHAT IF.
    The first residues in the file get number 1, 2, etc.
The residue type. Normally this is a three letter amino acid type.
The sequence number, between brackets. This is the residue number as it was
    given in the input file. It can be followed by the insertion code.
The chain identifier. A single character. If no chain identifier was given in
    the input file, this will be a minus sign or a blank.
A model number. If no model number exists, like in most X-ray files, this will
    be a blank or occasionally a minus sign.
In case an atom is part of the output, the atom will be listed using the PDB
    nomenclature for type and identifier.

To indicate the normality of a score, the score may be expressed as a Z-value
   or Z-score. This is just the number of standard deviations that the score
   deviates from the expected value. A property of Z-values is that the
   root-mean-square of a group of Z-values (the RMS Z-value) is expected to be
   1.0. Z-values above 4.0 and below -4.0 are very uncommon. If a Z-score is
   used in WHAT IF, the accompanying text will explain how the expected value
   and standard deviation were obtained.
The names of nucleic acids are DGUA, DTHY, OCYT, OADE, etc. The first character
   is a D or O for DNA or RNA respectively. This circumvents ambiguities in the
   many old PDB files in which DNA and RNA were both called A, C, G, and T.

# 1 # Note: Introduction
WHAT CHECK needs to read a PDB file before it can check it. It does a
series of checks upon reading the file. The results of these checks are
reported in this section (section 2.1). The rest of the report will be more
systematic in that section 2.2 reports on administrative problems. Section
2.3 gives descriptive output that is not directly validating things but
more telling you how WHAT CHECK interpreted the input file. Section 2.4
looks at B-factors, occupancies, and the presence/absence of (spurious)
atoms. Section 2.5 deals with nomenclature problems. Section 2.6 deals with
geometric problems like bond lengths and bond angles. Section 2.7 deals with
torsion angle issues. Section 2.8 looks at atomic clashes. Section 2.9 deals
with packing, accessibility, etc, issues. Section 2.10 deals with hydrogen
bonds, ion packing, and other things that can be summarized under the common
name charge-charge interactions. Section 2.11 gives a summary of whole report
and tells you (if applicable) which symmetry matrices were used. Section 2.12
tells the crystallographer which are the things most in need of manual
correction. And the last section, section 2.13, lists all residues sorted
by their need for visual inspection in light of the electron density.

# 13 # Warning: Problem detected upon counting molecules and matrices
The parameter Z as given on the CRYST card represents the molecular
multiplicity in the crystallographic cell. Normally, Z equals the number of
matrices of the space group multiplied by the number of NCS relations. The
value of Z is multiplied by the integrated molecular weight of the molecules
in the file to determine the Matthews coefficient. This relation is being
validated in this option. Be aware that the validation can get confused if
both multiple copies of the molecule are present in the ATOM records and
MTRIX records are present in the header of the PDB file.
 
 Space group as read from CRYST card: C 1 2 1
 Number of matrices in space group: 4
 Highest polymer chain multiplicity in structure: 2
 Highest polymer chain multiplicity according to SEQRES: 2
 No explicit MTRIX NCS matrices found in the input file
 Value of Z as found on the CRYST1 card: 0
 BIOMT matrices have been found but not enough to explain the difference
 
# 14 # Error: Matthews Coefficient (Vm) very high
 
The Matthews coefficient [REF] is defined as the density of the protein
structure in cubic Angstroms per Dalton. Normal values are between 1.5
(tightly packed, little room for solvent) and 4.0 (loosely packed, much
space for solvent). Some very loosely packed structures can get values a bit
higher than that.
 
Numbers this high are almost always caused by giving the wrong value for Z
on the CRYST1 card (or not giving this number at all).
 
 Molecular weight of all polymer chains: 187415.938
 Volume of the Unit Cell V= 2733509.5
 Space group multiplicity: 4
 No NCS symmetry matrices (MTRIX records) found in PDB file
 Matthews coefficient for observed atoms and Z is high: Vm= 29.171
 BIOMT matrices observed in the PDB file: 2
 But accounting for these BIOMT matrices does not make Vm reasonable yet
 Matthews coefficient read from REMARK 280 Vm= 2.800
 Vm by authors and this calculated Vm do not agree very well
 
# 15 # Note: Z missing on CRYST1 card
The messages above seem likely caused by the fact that Z is missing from the
CRYST1 card.
 
# 16 # Note: All atoms are sufficiently far away from symmetry axes
None of the atoms in the structure is closer than 0.77 Angstrom to a proper
symmetry axis.
 
# 17 # Note: Chain identifiers OK
WHAT CHECK has not detected any serious chain identifier problems. But be
aware that WHAT CHECK doesn't care about the chain identifiers of waters.
 
# 18 # Warning: Ligands for which a topology was generated automatically
The topology for the ligands in the table below were determined
automatically. WHAT CHECK uses a local copy of the CCP4 monomer library to
generate topology information for ligands. Be aware that automatic topology
generation is a complicated task. So, if you get messages that you fail to
understand or that you believe are wrong, and one of these ligands is
involved, then check the ligand topology entry first. This topology is either
present in the monomer library, or as a libcheck-generated file in the local
directory.

# 19 # Warning: Covalently bound ligands
The ligands in this table are covalently bound to something else. It is
already difficult to automatically generate topologies for ligands,
but when they are covalently bound to something it becomes even more
complicated to do everything right. So, if you get weird error messages
that seem related to this covalent bond, then please feel free to
ignore those, or even better, make a topology entry by hand.
 
The comment `Other ligand` indicates that the covalent bond is to another
ligand. In that case you might want to convert the two ligands into one
bigger ligand.

# 20 # Note: No strange inter-chain connections detected
No covalent bonds have been detected between molecules with non-identical
chain identifiers.
 
# 21 # Note: No duplicate atom names in ligands
All atom names in ligands (if any) seem adequately unique.
 
# 22 # Warning: Alternate atom problems
The residues listed in the table below have alternate atoms that do not
follow normal logic (like the first of the atoms gets label A and has the
highest occupancy). Residues listed here have at least one such problem.
The Note Mixed means that the the best solution found by WHAT CHECK has
mixed alternate atom labels. If the Note contains Occupancy, then at in at
least one case does the not-used alternate atom have a higher occupancy then
the one used. Corrected in the Note means that WHAT CHECK found a solution,
but that does not mean it is guaranteed solved. If you find weird problems
for this residue later-on in the report, especially when those are rotamer
or bump related, please look at this residue in the PDB file itself, solve
the problem by hand, and run WHAT CHECK again.

# 23 # Note: No residues detected inside ligands
Either this structure does not contain ligands with amino acid groups inside
it, or their naming is proper (enough).
 
# 24 # Warning: Groups attached to potentially hydrogen-bonding atoms
Residues were observed with groups attached to (or very near to) atoms that
potentially can form hydrogen bonds. WHAT CHECK is not very good at dealing
with such exceptional cases (Mainly because it's author is not...). So be
warned that the hydrogen-bonding related analyses of these residues
might be in error.
 
For example, an aspartic acid can be protonated on one of its delta
oxygens. This is possible because the one delta oxygen 'helps' the
other one holding that proton. However, if a delta oxygen has a group
bound to it, then it can no longer 'help' the other delta oxygen
bind the proton. However, both delta oxygens, in principle, can still
be hydrogen bond acceptors. Such problems can occur in the amino acids
Asp, Glu, and His. I have opted, for now to simply allow no hydrogen
bonds at all for any atom in any side chain that somewhere has a 'funny'
group attached to it. I know this is wrong, but there are only 12 hours
in a day.

# 25 # Warning: Plausible side chain atoms detected with zero occupancy
 
Plausible side chain atoms were detected with (near) zero occupancy
 
When crystallographers do not see an atom they either leave it out
completely, or give it an occupancy of zero or a very high B-factor.
WHAT CHECK neglects these atoms. In this case some atoms were found with
zero occupancy, but with coordinates that place them at a plausible
position. Although WHAT CHECK knows
how to deal with missing side chain atoms, validation will go more reliable
if all atoms are present. So, please consider to either set the occupancy
of the listed atoms at 1.0, or remove the residues from the PDB file.

# 26 # Warning: Plausible backbone atoms detected with zero occupancy
 
Plausible backbone atoms were detected with (near) zero occupancy
 
When crystallographers do not see an atom they either leave it out
completely,
or give it an occupancy of zero or a very high B-factor. WHAT CHECK neglects
these atoms. However, if a backbone atom is present in the PDB file, and its
position seems 'logical' (i.e. normal bond lengths with all atoms it should
be bound to, and those atoms exist normally) WHAT CHECK will set the
occupancy
to 1.0 if it believes that the full presence of this atom will be beneficial
to the rest of the validation process. If you get weird errors at, or near,
these atoms, please check by hand what is going on, and repair things
intelligently before running this validation again.

'the soup'. The content of this soup is listed here. An extensive explanation
of all frequently used WHAT CHECK output formats can be found at
swift.cmbi.ru.nl. Look under output formats. A course on reading this
'Molecules' table is part of the WHAT CHECK website.

# 30 # Note: Ramachandran plot
In this Ramachandran plot x-signs represent glycines, squares represent
prolines, and plus-signs represent the other residues. If too many
plus-signs fall outside the contoured areas then the molecule is poorly
refined (or worse). Proline can only occur in the narrow region around
phi=-60 that also falls within the other contour islands.
 
In a colour picture, the residues that are part of a helix are shown in blue,
strand residues in red. Preferred regions for helical residues are drawn in
blue, for strand residues in red, and for all other residues in green. A full
explanation of the Ramachandran plot together with a series of examples can
be found at the WHAT CHECK website [REF].

# 40 # Note: Secondary structure
This is the secondary structure according to DSSP. Only helix (H), overwound
or 3/10-helix (3), strand (S), turn (T) and coil (blank) are shown [REF].
All DSSP related information can be found at swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/
This is not really a structure validation option, but a very scattered
secondary structure (i.e. many strands of only a few residues length, many
Ts inside helices, etc) tends to indicate a poor structure. A full
explanation of the DSSP secondary structure determination program together
with a series of examples can be found at the WHAT CHECK website [REF].

# 41 # Note: No rounded coordinates detected
No significant rounding of atom coordinates has been detected.
 
# 42 # Note: No artificial side chains detected
No artificial side-chain positions characterized by chi-1=0.0 or chi-1=180.0
have been detected.
 
# 43 # Note: No missing atoms detected in residues
All expected atoms are present in residues. This validation option has not
looked at 'things' that can or should be attached to the elementary building
blocks (amino acids, nucleotides). Even the C-terminal oxygens are treated
separately.
 
# 44 # Note: All B-factors fall in the range 0.0 - 100.0
All B-factors are larger than zero, and none are observed above 100.0.
 
# 45 # Note: C-terminus capping
The residues listed in the table below are either C-terminal or pseudo
C-terminal (i.e. last residue before a missing residue).
In X-ray the coordinates must be located in density. Mobility or disorder
sometimes cause this density to be so poor that the positions of the atoms
cannot be determined. Crystallographers tend to leave out the atoms in such
cases. In many cases the N- or C-terminal residues are too disordered to see.
In case of the N-terminus, you can often see from the residue numbers if
there are missing residues; at the C-terminus this is impossible. Therefore,
often the position of the backbone nitrogen of the first residue missing
at the C-terminal end is calculated and added to indicate that there
are missing residues. As a single N causes validation trouble, we remove
these single-N-residues before doing the validation. If this happened,
the label -N is added to the pseudo C-terminus. Other labels can be +X
in case something weird is bound to the backbone C, or +OXT if a spurious
OXT atom is found. -OXT indicates that an expected OXT is missing. 'Swap'
means that the O' and O'' (O and OXT in PDB files) have been swapped in
terms of nomenclature. 'Bad' means that something bad happened that WHAT IF
does not understand. In such cases you might get three residue numbers in
square brackets; one of those might be what WHAT IF had expected to find,
but then it also might not). In case of chain breaks the number of missing
residues is listen in round brackets. OK means what it suggests...
 
Be aware that we cannot easily see the difference between these errors and
errors in the chain and residue numbering schemes. So do not blindly trust
the table below. If you get weird errors at, or near, the left-over
incomplete C-terminal residue, please check by hand if a missing Oxt or
a removed single N is the cause. Also, many peptidic ligands get the same
chain identifier as the larger protein they are bound to. In such cases there
are more than one C-termini and OXTs with the same ID. WHAT IF gives some
random warnings about these cases. So, don't take everything at face value,
but think for yourself.

# 46 # Note: Weights administratively correct
All atomic occupancy factors ('weights') fall in the 0.0--1.0 range, which
makes them administratively correct.
 
# 47 # Note: Normal distribution of occupancy values
 
The distribution of the occupancy values in this file seems 'normal'.
 
Be aware that this evaluation is merely the result of comparing this file
with about 500 well-refined high-resolution files in the PDB. If this file
has much higher or much lower resolution than the PDB files used
in WHAT CHECK's training set, non-normal values might very well be perfectly
fine, or normal values might actually be not so normal. So, this check is
actually more an indicator and certainly not a check in which I have great
confidence.
 
# 48 # Warning: Occupancy atoms do not add up to 1.0.
In principle, the occupancy of all alternates of one atom should add up till
1.0. A valid exception is the missing atom (i.e. an atom not seen in the
electron density) that is allowed to have a 0.0 occupancy. Sometimes this
even happens when there are no alternate atoms given...
 
Atoms want to move. That is the direct result of the second law of
thermodynamics, in a somewhat weird way of thinking. Any way, many atoms
seem to have more than one position where they like to sit, and they jump
between them. The population difference between those sites (which is related
to their energy differences) is seen in the occupancy factors. As also for
atoms it is 'to be or not to be', these occupancies should add up to 1.0.
Obviously, it is possible that they add up to a number less than 1.0, in
cases where there are yet more, but undetected' rotamers/positions in play,
but also in those cases a warning is in place as the information shown
in the PDB file is less certain than it could have been. The residues
listed below contain atoms that have an occupancy greater than zero, but
their alternates do not add up to one. 'Strange' is added as a comment when
we believe that the structure shows no obvious reasons why this residue
should have a reduced occupancy.
 
WARNING. Presently WHAT CHECK only deals with a maximum of two alternate
positions. A small number of atoms in the PDB has three alternates. In
those cases the warning given here should obviously be neglected!
In a next release we will try to fix this.

# 49 # Warning: What type of B-factor?
WHAT CHECK does not yet know well how to cope with B-factors in case TLS has
been used. It simply assumes that the B-factor listed on the ATOM and HETATM
cards are the total B-factors. When TLS refinement is used that assumption
sometimes is not correct. The header of the PDB file states that TLS groups
were used. So, if WHAT CHECK complains about your  B-factors, while you think
that they are OK, then check for TLS related B-factor problems first.
 
Number of TLS groups mentione in PDB file header: 1
 
Crystal temperature (K) :100.000
 
# 50 # Warning: More than 5 percent of buried atoms has low B-factor
For normal protein structures, no more than about 1 percent of the B factors
of buried atoms is below 5.0. The fact that this value is much higher in the
current structure could be a signal that the B-factors were restraints or
constraints to too-low values, misuse of B-factor field in the PDB file, or
a TLS/scaling problem. If the average B factor is low too, it is probably a
low temperature structure determination.  In liquid nitrogen this
percentage is allowed to be higher, of course.
 
Percentage of buried atoms with B less than 5 :  16.21
 
# 51 # Note: B-factor plot
The average atomic B-factor per residue is plotted as function of the residue
number.

# 62 # Note: Introduction to the nomenclature section.
Nomenclature problems seem, at first, rather unimportant. After all who
cares if we call the delta atoms in leucine delta2 and delta1 rather than
the other way around. Chemically speaking that is correct. But structures
have not been solved and deposited just for chemists to look at them. Most
times a structure is used, it is by software in a bioinformatics lab. And
if they compare structures in which the one used C delta1 and delta2 and the
other uses C delta2 and delta1, then that comparison will fail. Also, we
recalculate all structures every so many years to make sure that everybody
always can get access to the best coordinates that can be obtained from
the (your?) experimental data. These recalculations will be troublesome if
there are nomenclature problems.
 
Several nomenclature problems actually are worse than that. At the
WHAT CHECK website [REF] you can get an overview of the importance of all
nomenclature problems that we list.

# 76 # Warning: Low bond length variability
Bond lengths were found to deviate less than normal from the mean Engh and
Huber [REF] and/or Parkinson et al [REF] standard bond lengths. The RMS
Z-score given below is expected to be near 1.0 for a normally restrained
data set. The fact that it is lower than 0.667 in this structure might
indicate that too-strong restraints have been used in the refinement. This
can only be a problem  for high resolution X-ray structures.
 
 RMS Z-score for bond lengths: 0.594
 RMS-deviation in bond distances: 0.013
 
# 77 # Warning: Possible cell scaling problem
Comparison of bond distances with Engh and Huber [REF] standard values for
protein residues and Parkinson et al [REF] values for DNA/RNA shows a
significant systematic deviation. It could be that the unit cell used in
refinement was not accurate enough. The deformation matrix given below gives
the deviations found: the three numbers on the diagonal represent the
relative corrections needed along the A, B and C cell axis. These values are
1.000 in a normal case, but have significant deviations here (significant at
the 99.99 percent confidence level)
 
There are a number of different possible causes for the discrepancy. First
the cell used in refinement can be different from the best cell calculated.
Second, the value of the wavelength used for a synchrotron data set can be
miscalibrated. Finally, the discrepancy can be caused by a dataset that has
not been corrected for significant anisotropic thermal motion.
 
Please note that the proposed scale matrix has NOT been restrained to obey
the space group symmetry. This is done on purpose. The distortions can give
you an indication of the accuracy of the determination.
 
If you intend to use the result of this check to change the cell dimension
of your crystal, please read the extensive literature on this topic first.
This check depends on the wavelength, the cell dimensions, and on the
standard bond lengths and bond angles used by your refinement software.

# 81 # Warning: Chirality deviations detected
The atoms listed in the table below have an improper dihedral value that is
deviating from expected values. As the improper dihedral values are all
getting very close to ideal values in recent X-ray structures, and as we
actually do not know how big the spread around these values should be, this
check only warns for 6 sigma deviations.
 
Improper dihedrals are a measure of the chirality/planarity of the structure
at a specific atom. Values around -35 or +35 are expected for chiral atoms,
and values around 0 for planar atoms. Planar side chains are left out of the
calculations, these are better handled by the planarity checks.
 
Three numbers are given for each atom in the table. The first is the Z-score
for the improper dihedral. The second number is the measured improper
dihedral. The third number is the expected value for this atom type. A final
column contains an extra warning if the chirality for an atom is opposite
to the expected value.
 
Please also see the previous table that lists a series of administrative
chirality problems that were corrected automatically upon reading-in the
PDB file.

structures, rather than from CSD data, so we cannot be 100 percent certain
about these numbers.

# 85 # Error: Side chain planarity problems
The side chains of the residues listed in the table below contain a planar
group that was found to deviate from planarity by more than 4.0 times the
expected value. For an amino acid residue that has a side chain with a
planar group, the RMS deviation of the atoms to a least squares plane was
determined. The number in the table is the number of standard deviations
this RMS value deviates from the expected value. Not knowing better yet, we
assume that planarity of the groups analyzed should be perfect.

because WHAT CHECK found no reason to cry.
 
# 89 # Warning: Torsion angle evaluation shows unusual residues
The residues listed in the table below contain bad or abnormal
torsion angles.
 
These scores give an impression of how `normal' the torsion angles in
protein residues are. All torsion angles except omega are used for
calculating a `normality' score. Average values and standard deviations were
obtained from the residues in the WHAT CHECK database. These are used to
calculate Z-scores. A residue with a Z-score of below -2.0 is poor, and a
score of less than -3.0 is worrying. For such residues more than one torsion
angle is in a highly unlikely position.

# 93 # Warning: Unusual rotamers
The residues listed in the table below have a rotamer that is not seen very

for every residue the position specific chi-1 rotamer distribution.
Thereafter it verified whether the actual residue in the molecule has the
most preferred rotamer or not. If the actual rotamer is the preferred one,
the score is 1.0. If the actual rotamer is unique, the score is 0.0. If
there are two preferred rotamers, with a population distribution of 3:2 and
your rotamer sits in the lesser populated rotamer, the score will be 0.667.
No value will be given if insufficient hits are found in the database.
 
It is not necessarily an error if a few residues have rotamer values below
0.3, but careful inspection of all residues with these low values could be
worth it.

# 94 # Warning: Unusual backbone conformations
For the residues listed in the table below, the backbone formed by itself and
two neighbouring residues on either side is in a conformation that is not
seen very often in the database of solved protein structures. The number
given in the table is the number of similar backbone conformations in the
database with the same amino acid in the centre.
 
For this check, backbone conformations are compared with database structures
using C-alpha superpositions with some restraints on the backbone oxygen
positions.
 
A residue mentioned in the table can be part of a strange loop, or there
might be something wrong with it or its directly surrounding residues. There
are a few of these in every protein, but in any case it is worth looking at,
especially if a regular DSSP secondary structure (H or S for helix or strand,
respectively) is indicated!

# 97 # Warning: Unusual PRO puckering amplitudes
The proline residues listed in the table below have a puckering amplitude
that is outside of normal ranges. Puckering parameters were calculated by
the method of Cremer and Pople [REF]. Normal PRO rings have a puckering
amplitude Q between 0.20 and 0.45 Angstrom. If Q is lower than 0.20 Angstrom
for a PRO residue, this could indicate disorder between the two different
normal ring forms (with C-gamma below and above the ring, respectively). If
Q is higher than 0.45 Angstrom something could have gone wrong during the
refinement. Be aware that this is a warning with a low confidence level. See:

# 98 # Warning: Unusual PRO puckering phases
The proline residues listed in the table below have a puckering phase that is
not expected to occur in protein structures. Puckering parameters were
calculated by the method of Cremer and Pople [REF]. Normal PRO rings
approximately show a so-called envelope conformation with the C-gamma atom
above the plane of the ring (phi=+72 degrees), or a half-chair conformation
with C-gamma below and C-beta above the plane of the ring (phi=-90 degrees).
If phi deviates strongly from these values, this is indicative of a very
strange conformation for a PRO residue, and definitely requires a manual
check of the data. Be aware that this is a warning with a low confidence
level. See: Who checks the checkers? Four validation tools applied to eight
atomic resolution structures [REF].

# 99 # Warning: Backbone oxygen evaluation
The residues listed in the table below have an unusual backbone oxygen
position.
 
For each of the residues in the structure, a search was performed to find
5-residue stretches in the WHAT CHECK database with superposable C-alpha
coordinates, and some restraints on the neighbouring backbone oxygens.
 
In the following table the RMS distance between the backbone oxygen positions
of these matching structures in the database and the position of the backbone
oxygen atom in the current residue is given. If this number is larger than
1.5 a significant number of structures in the database show an alternative
position for the backbone oxygen. If the number is larger than 2.0 most
matching backbone fragments in the database have the peptide plane flipped.
A manual check needs to be performed to assess whether the experimental data
can support that alternative as well. The number in the last column is the
number of database hits (maximum 80) used in the calculation. It is "normal"
that some glycine residues show up in this list, but they are still worth
checking!

# 101 # Error: Abnormally short interatomic distances
The pairs of atoms listed in the table below have an unusually short
distance; each bump is listed in only one direction,
 
The contact distances of all atom pairs have been checked. Two atoms are
said to `bump' if they are closer than the sum of their Van der Waals radii
minus 0.40 Angstrom. For hydrogen bonded pairs a tolerance of 0.55 Angstrom
is used. The first number in the table tells you how much shorter that
specific contact is than the acceptable limit. The second distance is the
distance between the centres of the two atoms.
 
The last text-item on each line represents the status of the atom pair. The
text `INTRA' means that the bump is between atoms that are explicitly listed
in the PDB file. `INTER' means it is an inter-symmetry bump. If the final
column contains the text 'HB', the bump criterion was relaxed because there
could be a hydrogen bond. Similarly relaxed criteria are used for 1--3 and
1--4 interactions (listed as 'B2' and 'B3', respectively). If the last column
is 'BF', the sum of the B-factors of the atoms is higher than 80, which makes
the appearance of the bump somewhat less severe because the atoms probably
are not there anyway. BL, on the other hand, indicates that the bumping atoms
both have a low B-factor, and that makes the bumps more worrisome.
 
It seems likely that at least some of the reported bumps are caused by
administrative errors in the chain names. I.e. covalently bound atoms with
different non-blank chain-names are reported as bumps. In rare cases this is
not an error.
 
Bumps between atoms for which the sum of their occupancies is lower than one
are not reported. If the MODEL number does not exist (as is the case in most
X-ray files), a minus sign is printed instead.

The residues listed in the table below have an unusual packing environment.
 
The packing environment of the residues is compared with the average packing
environment for all residues of the same type in good PDB files. A low
packing score can indicate one of several things: Poor packing, misthreading
of the sequence through the density, crystal contacts, contacts with a
co-factor, or the residue is part of the active site. It is not uncommon to
see a few of these, but in any case this requires further inspection of the
residue.

# 145 # Note: Histidine type assignments
For all complete HIS residues in the structure a tentative assignment to
HIS-D (protonated on ND1), HIS-E (protonated on NE2), or HIS-H (protonated
on both ND1 and NE2, positively charged) is made based on the hydrogen bond
network. A second assignment is made based on which of the Engh and Huber
[REF] histidine geometries fits best to the structure.
 
In the table below all normal histidine residues are listed. The assignment
based on the geometry of the residue is listed first, together with the RMS
Z-score for the fit to the Engh and Huber parameters. For all residues where
the H-bond assignment is different, the assignment is listed in the last
columns, together with its RMS Z-score to the Engh and Huber parameters.
 
As always, the RMS Z-scores should be close to 1.0 if the residues were
restrained to the Engh and Huber parameters during refinement, and if
enough (high resolution) data is available.
 
Please note that because the differences between the geometries of the
different types are small it is possible that the geometric assignment given
here does not correspond to the type used in refinement. This is especially
true if the RMS Z-scores are much higher than 1.0.
 
If the two assignments differ, or the `geometry' RMS Z-score is high, it is
advisable to verify the hydrogen bond assignment, check the HIS type used
during the refinement and possibly adjust it.

# 146 # Warning: Buried unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors
The buried hydrogen bond donors listed in the table below have a hydrogen
atom that is not involved in a hydrogen bond in the optimized hydrogen bond
network.
 
Hydrogen bond donors that are buried inside the protein normally use all of
their hydrogens to form hydrogen bonds within the protein. If there are any
non hydrogen bonded buried hydrogen bond donors in the structure they will
be listed here. In very good structures the number of listed atoms will tend
to zero.

# 148 # Note: Some notes regarding these donors and acceptors
The donors and acceptors have been counted, also as function of their
accessibility. The buried donors and acceptors have been binned in five
categories ranging from not forming any hydrogen bond till forming a poor
till perfect hydrogen bond. Obviously, the buried donors and acceptors
with no or just a poor hydrogen bond should be a topic of concern. As every
protein contains more acceptors than donors, unsatisfied donors are more in
need of attention than unsatisfied acceptors.

# 150 # Note: Summary report
This is an overall summary of the quality of the structure as compared with
current reliable structures. Numbers in brackets are the average and standard
deviation observed for a large number of files determined with a similar
resolution.
 
The second table mostly gives an impression of how well the model conforms
to common refinement restraint values. These numbers are less than 1.0 if the
spread in data is too little, and larger than 1.0 when the spread is too
large. The former does not need to be a problem, the latter always is bad.
 
 Structure Z-scores, positive is better than average:
  Resolution read from PDB file  :   2.530
  1st generation packing quality :  -0.782 (          (  -0.5,  2.5))
  2nd generation packing quality :  -0.787 (          (  -1.5,  1.2))
  Ramachandran plot appearance   :  -3.425 (poor      (  -2.7,  1.6))
  chi-1/chi-2 rotamer normality  :  -5.403 (bad       (  -4.5,  1.7))
  Backbone conformation          :   0.207 (          (  -0.8,  3.7))
  Inside/Outside distribution    :   0.954
 
 RMS Z-scores, should be close to 1.0:
  Bond lengths                   :   0.594 (tight)
  Bond angles                    :   0.762
  Omega angle restraints         :   1.261
  Side chain planarity           :   0.970
  Improper dihedral distribution :   0.774
 
# 151 # Note: Introduction to refinement recommendations
First, be aware that the recommendations for crystallographers listed below
are produced by a computer program that was written by a guy who got his
PhD in NMR...
 
We have tried to convert the messages written in this report into a small
set of things you can do with your refinement software to get a better
structure. The things you should do first are listed first. And in some
cases you should first fix that problem, then refine a bit further, and
then run WHAT CHECK again before looking at other problems. If, for example,
WHAT CHECK has found a problem with the SCALE and CRYST cards, then you must
first fix that problem, refine the structure a bit further, and run WHAT
CHECK again because errors in the SCALE and or CRYST card can lead to many
problems elsewhere in the validation process.
 
It is also important to keep in mind that WHAT CHECK is software and that it
occasionally totally misunderstands what is the cause of a problem. But, if
WHAT CHECK lists a problem there normally is a problem albeit that it not
always is the actual problem that gets listed.
 
# 152 # Note: Matthews coefficient problem
WHAT CHECK detected a Matthews coefficient problem. Most times this is an
administrative problem caused by typing the wrong cell multiplicity number
on the CRYST card (or not typing it at all). Occasionally it is caused by
typing the wrong space group on the CRYST card. You better fix this problem,
but normally this problem does not cause WHAT CHECK to give any erroneous
error messages further down in the report.
 
# 153 # Note: Cell parameter anomaly
WHAT CHECK has compared the observed bond lengths with the Engh and Huber
parameters, and has done this as function of the direction of the bond
relative to the cell axes. From this analysis it was concluded that the
cell dimensions are probably not entirely perfect. The problem is not very
big, so you do not need to fix this before you start dealing with the other
suggestions, but you better fix this.
 
If this problem is caused by refining with another set of target values
than the Engh and Huber values, then WHAT CHECK cannot help you because
systematic target value deviations can also cause this message to pop up.
 
# 154 # Error: Bumps in your structure
Upon analysing the bumps in your structure, WHAT CHECK got very, very
worried. Sometimes this means that you have forgotten to lower the
occupancy of overlapping ligands, residues, or water molecules. But,
whatever is the origin of this problem, you have to analyse it and
fix it.
 
# 155 # Note: Bond angle variabilty Z-score high
With a resolution of 2.5-3.0 Angstrom, you dont have enough data to warrant
the bond angle variability that we observed (almost 1.0). So, you better
tighten
the screws on the bond angle target values a bit.
 
# 156 # Note: His, Asn, Gln side chain flips.
His, Asn, and Gln have an asymmetry in their side chain that is hard to
detect unless you have data at much better than 1.0 Angstrom resolution.
WHAT CHECK thinks that your structure contains His, Asn, or Gln residues that
will make better hydrogen bonds when flipped around their chi-2, chi-2, or
chi-3 side chain torsion angle, respectively. You better
check these Asn, His, and Gln residues, and if you use a refinement program
that includes molecular dynamics, then you must (after the
flips were made) refine a bit further before running WHAT CHECK again.
 
# 157 # Note: Free floating waters
Your structure contains a few water molecules that make no hydrogen bonds at
all. These waters must be removed, and you must then refine a bit further
before running WHAT CHECK again.
 
# 158 # Warning: Troublesome residues
The residues listed in the table below need to be inspected
 
This table is a very rough attempt to sort the residues according to how
badly they need your attention. The idea is that when you sit in  in front
of the graphics screen and study the residues with the electron density
present that you improve the structure most by dealing with the top residues
in this list first.
