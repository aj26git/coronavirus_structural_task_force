Poorly-resolved regions drifted far from correct. Restrained back to higher-resolution models where necessary:

A846-849 out by 1 (puts Val848 in place of Lys849 contacting RNA)

While truncating a sidechain is ace
If the C-beta points into space
The decision's more rash
If the atoms would clash
Chances are your backbone's out of place.

Cannot comfortably fit chain F Cys16-Cys19-His33-His39 zinc site. While there is a "zinc-like" blob, the geometry seems way off. Possibly multiple conformers here, or something needs to shift dramatically - but the density isn't clear enough to confidently remodel. Left the zinc in place, but care is needed in interpretation.
