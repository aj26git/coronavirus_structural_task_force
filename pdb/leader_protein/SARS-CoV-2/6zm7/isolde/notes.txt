(Updated 17/03/2021)

- approx. 40 nucleotide bases flipped
- Chain LI is mis-identified: assigned as 60S ribosomal protein L10-like (Q96L21), should be 60S ribosomal protein L10 (P27635 or X5D2T3). Sequences differ at 9/10 of 211 sites (P27635 and X5D2T3 are identical at 9 of the 10 variable sites - cannot distinguish remaining site (Asn/Ser) from density).
- Original model contains only a single cis-Pro. 20 cis-prolines clearly identifiable in density.
- 22 cis and 64 twisted non-proline peptides (one of the cis peptides - chain SF, Met78-His79 - appears real)
- numerous peptide bond flips and rotamer adjustments
- many metals modelled as magnesium. Geometry suggests some of these may be other metals. Many unmodelled metal sites. Haven't attempted to remedy this.
- LL, residues 135-144 out of register by 1
- chain LM: no N-terminal MET
- chain LN: no N-terminal MET
- His 37 of chain LN looks like it's beta-hydroxylated (beta-hydroxylation of histidines is a known modification of ribosomes - see https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-018-2903-z - but I don't know of any experimental evidence for this particular site).
- Chain LQ: no N-terminal MET
- Residues 2 to 4 of chain LS out of register by 1
- Chain LU N-terminal residues 17-19 flipped around backbone
- LW, residues 63 onwards very poorly resolved - will only be reliable with good reference model.
- chain Lc, C-term 101-106 out of register by 1/partially unfolded. Added 3 more residues to the C-terminus after correcting
- Lj: no N-terminal MET
- Lk: no N-terminal MET
- Ll: no N-terminal MET
- Lo: no N-terminal MET
- Lp: no N-terminal MET
- chains Ls and Lt barely resolved - local resolution mostly >6A
- chain S2: *very* strange base-pairing/mismatches at 928-1013 (GU) and 930-1011 (CA)
- SF: Met78-His79 is cis (supported by 6zol)
- SR: deleted N-terminal MET (doesn't appear to be present)
- SS: deleted N-terminal MET (SER 2 should be N-acetylated according to UniProt entry)
- chain SS C-terminus is difficult - complicated by non-descript tube of density which appears to continue the backbone past Arg142. This makes for a very uncomfortable turn, and I was unable to find a sensible fit for sidechains here. This tube is not present in related ribosome structures 6om0 and 6qzp. I strongly suspect this tube belongs to something else - remodelled accordingly.
- SV: N-terminal MET is acetylated (clearly shows in density, annotated in UniProt P63220); sidechain flipped around backbone
- SX: no N-terminal MET
- Sa: no N-terminal MET
- Sd: no N-terminal MET
- Cys Sd 39 swung away from coordinating Zn
- SO: SER137-ASP138 very constrained - might be a cis peptide?
- SW: no N-terminal MET
- SY: C-terminal helix (121-end) needed to shift in register 2 residues towards C-terminus. Deleted residues 128 onwards
- Sf: zinc finger (Cys121,126,141,144) very messed up - zinc way out of place
 
6ZOL: chain F Met78-His79 is cis
